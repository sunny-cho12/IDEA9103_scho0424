# IDEA9103_scho0424
IDEA9103 Group D / Functioning prototype (user input)

---

## How to Interact
- `A` key → Toggle bull animation on/off  
- `W` key → Toggle background animation on/off  
- Click the shape → Changes the background colour to hue of the pixel

## Individual approach 

I employed ***interaction-based*** animation.
Users can pause or play the animation through keyboard inputs, and clicking anywhere on the canvas changes the background colour. 

I focused on the **dynamic colour palette and movement** of the original painting. Since there are a limited number of colours used in the original work, I created the animation to make these colours more visible. Through the clicking the grid, the user can explore and understand the colour distribution of the artwork.

Furthermore, the users can pause or play movements of the background and the bull separately, allowing user to focus more attention on the rhythm and contrast and on the visual changes generated by the movement.

To distinguish my work from my group members, I focused on emphasising *colour and switching between stillness and movement*. In contrast, one of my group members created an animation that the background responds to audio input, and another generate a flowing, wavy visual effect.

## References

I was inspired by Jamie Zigelbaum and Marcelo Coelho's work [Six-Forty by Four-Eighty] (https://jamiezigelbaum.com/six-forty-by-four-eighty).
This installation features a grid structure composed of pixels, each responding to the user's touch to change in various ways, such as altering speed or colour. I was particularly impressed by how the user's interaction directly influences both colour and movement. 

I implemented this concept in my project by allowing the user to click on the canvas, which then changes the background colour depending on location. Furthermore, the code allows the user to control the movement. Through this, I aimed to allow the user to directly explore colour composition and contrast, and provide an experience of interacting with the artwork.

## Technical Explanation

1. Interaction Control

***Keyboard Interaction***
Press “w”: change background animation
Press “a”: change bull animation

This allows users to pause or play movement, making the contrast between stillness and motion.

***Mouse Interaction***

When the user clicks anywhere on the canvas, the pixel colour is taken using the code below. 

```js
gridColour = get(mouseX, mouseY);
```

2. Changes from the Group Code

To make colour changes easier and user control more accessible, I have adjusted the group code as follows. 

- Added interaction controls (keyboard + click)
- Implemented animation variables for background and bull
- Addded grid colour variable for background colour changes
- Adjusted grid sizes and shape sizes seperately for background and bull
- Adjusted the bull’s position to remain in the centre across different screen sizes
- Modified draw order and scaling logic to maintain layout consistency

*Code Simplification & Removal*

I also removed overlapping or redundant draw logic from the original group code (sketch.js) to streamline the animation and avoid double-rendering.

## External sources and referenced techniques

The “How to Use” interface was adapted and modified from the following GitHub example:

CSS + JS Check List Animation by Mridul

While applying the core techniques from this example, I adjusted the layout, colour, font sapcing to match the visual style.
